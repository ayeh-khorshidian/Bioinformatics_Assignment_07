# Python Bioinformatics Assignment III

This repository contains solutions for Python programming tasks focused on file handling and directory operations, essential for bioinformatics applications.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Writing to a File
A program that writes numbers from 1 to 100 to a file named `NumberList.txt`, each on a separate line.

### Task 2: Reading from a File
A program that reads numbers from `NumberList.txt`, displays each number, and prints the total sum of these numbers.

### Task 3: Working with Directories
A program that reads all sequence files in a specified directory (default name `sequences`), appends their content to `Output.txt`, and separates each sequence file with `||`.

## Usage

Run `Bioinformatics_Assignment_07.py` in a Python environment. Ensure that a directory named `sequences` with sequence files is available in the same directory as the script for Task 3 to execute successfully.
